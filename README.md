## Piece Lore System

BoardSaga features a unique lore system that gives each chess piece its own personality and voice. Stories generated by BoardSaga incorporate these characteristics to create engaging narratives.

### The Pieces

- **Pawn**: Humble and ambitious, dreaming of promotion
- **Rook**: The unwavering guardian of territory
- **Knight**: The unpredictable strategic trickster
- **Bishop**: The spiritual guide with mystic insight
- **Queen**: The sovereign commander with boundless power
- **King**: The crown bearing the weight of the kingdom

Each piece has catch-phrases and personality traits that are woven into generated stories. For the complete lore reference, see [lib/prompts/LORE.md](./lib/prompts/LORE.md).
