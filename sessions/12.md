**Technical Notes**:
- Used wood color palette: #D4A373 (light oak), #C19A6B (medium), #8B4513 (dark), #6B3410 (darker)
- Board colors: #EEE8D3 (cream), #C19A6B (brown)
- Applied gradients extensively for subtle depth without textures
- Typography system uses CSS custom properties for easy theming
- Easter eggs use click-counting with timeouts to distinguish from normal clicks
- All animations are subtle and lightweight (scale transforms, opacity, translateY)
- Desktop-first approach as per requirements

**Design Decisions**:
- Stylized abstract wood tones with gradients instead of realistic textures for performance
- Flat colors with shadows instead of textures
- Barely-there animations for lean performance
- Interactive animations only (no ambient effects)
- Crimson Text serif for stories for classic reading experience
- Plus Jakarta Sans for UI for modern, clean look

**Remaining Tasks for Phase 5**:
- StoryViewer micro-interactions (hover effects on paragraphs, interactive elements)
- StoryViewer easter egg (something creative for story reading)
- ChessBoard theme (wood board colors, gradients)
- ChessBoard animation (piece movement from previous → shown position when board comes into view)
- ChessBoard hover animations (piece hover effects)
- ChessBoard micro-interactions (subtle interactive feedback)
- ChessBoard easter egg (fun hidden feature)
- Story detail page theme (warm colors, improved layout)
- Story detail page transition (simple page transition)
- History page cards theme (wood theme, shadows)
- History cards hover animations
- Pages integration (integrate all updated components across main pages)
- Page transitions across the app
- Cross-page compatibility testing
- Animation performance testing (ensure site remains lean)
- Run lint and typecheck
- Document session completion

**Next Steps**:
The next agent should continue with the remaining ChessBoard enhancements, as these are high-priority tasks that form the core visual experience of the application. Focus on:
1. ChessBoard theme (wood colors)
2. ChessBoard piece movement animation
3. ChessBoard hover effects and micro-interactions
4. ChessBoard easter egg

Then proceed with page-level enhancements (story detail, history page) and final testing.
