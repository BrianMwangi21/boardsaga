### Session 003 - Phase 1 Implementation

**Date**: December 29, 2025

**Summary**:
- Completed Phase 1: PGN Upload & Parsing
- Implemented full PGN upload workflow with drag-and-drop
- Created reusable Header and Footer components
- Built server-side PGN parsing API with chess.js

**Completed**:
- Updated AGENTS.md to reflect app/components/ directory structure
- Installed dependencies: chess.js and react-dropzone
- Created Header component with navigation (Home, Stories, GitHub)
- Created Footer component with copyright and GitHub link
- Updated layout.tsx to include Header and Footer with fixed viewport
- Created PGNUploader component with react-dropzone for file upload
- Created PGN parser library with parsePGN and validatePGN functions
- Created API route at /api/parse-pgn for server-side parsing
- Updated main page to integrate PGN upload and display parsed data

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `AGENTS.md` - Updated directory structure reference
- `package.json` - Added chess.js and react-dropzone dependencies
- `app/layout.tsx` - Integrated Header and Footer with fixed viewport
- `app/components/ui/Header.tsx` - New header component
- `app/components/ui/Footer.tsx` - New footer component
- `app/components/pgn/PGNUploader.tsx` - New PGN upload component
- `lib/pgn-parser.ts` - PGN parsing utilities with TypeScript interfaces
- `app/api/parse-pgn/route.ts` - Server-side PGN parsing endpoint
- `app/page.tsx` - Main page with PGN upload and parsed data display

**Features Implemented**:
- Drag-and-drop PGN file upload
- Client-side validation
- Server-side PGN parsing
- Structured display of game metadata (players, ELOs, event, result, date, time control)
- Move list display with move numbers
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Reset functionality to upload new games

**Next Steps**:
- Start Phase 2: LLM Integration
- Set up Vercel AI SDK
- Design prompts for game analysis

**Notes**:
- Fixed viewport layout to ensure app fits screen without scrolling for header/footer
- Used libraries instead of custom implementations for simplicity (chess.js, react-dropzone)
- PGN parsing happens server-side as per long-term architecture
- Parsed data stored in variable for now, MongoDB setup planned for later
