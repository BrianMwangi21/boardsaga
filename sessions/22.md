## Session File Organization

### Renamed Files

Changed single-digit session files to double-digit format for proper ordering:
- `1.md` → `01.md`
- `2.md` → `02.md`
- `3.md` → `03.md`
- `4.md` → `04.md`
- `5.md` → `05.md`
- `6.md` → `06.md`
- `7.md` → `07.md`
- `8.md` → `08.md`
- `9.md` → `09.md`

Files 10.md through 21.md were already double-digit (no changes needed).

**Result**: Sessions now display in proper numerical order (01-22) when listed.
